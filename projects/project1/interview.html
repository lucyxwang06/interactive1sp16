	<h1>Q&A: Motown's Diana Ross reflects on career; she performs Friday in Metro Detroit</h1>

	<h3>Ross on touring</h3>

	<p>Touring to me is like, each place, even though I might be returning, it feels brand new. And it's like a new adventure. I tour because I enjoy it and I am having fun.</p>

	<h3>On singing</h3>

	<p>I love to sing. I love performing before an audience and entertaining, it makes me feel good, and I do hope that the audience shares in that feel good feeling. I have a wonderful backing band, rhythm section, horns and singers and we just have a good time on stage we really have fun.</p>

	<h3>On her touring Band</h3>

	<p>My band and I have been together for a very long time. We're like family. We enjoy each others company and it really is like PLAY, we have FUN! We have a joyful time performing.</p>

	<h3>On variety she brings on stage</h3>

	<p>When I am performing, I wear many different hats. What I mean by that is, I am the producer, the organizer, I am also the parent or mother on the road because I care about everyone. I want to make sure they are all well. I try to take care of them. The mothering part of me becomes very much a part of the actual touring.</p>

	<h3>On who she brings with on tour</h3>

	<p>I also have made really good friends that everyone that I travel with.My keyboard player has been with me the longest and my drummer and bass player are really the backbone of the entire band. They are like the heartbeat, they keep us filled with love and enjoying the whole process.</p>

	<h3>On how involved she is with every aspect of tour</h3>

	<p>I am involved in the selection of music, of course my costumes, the lighting and setting and really the interaction between me and the audience, my unit, my band and the audience. I have always been interested in the precision of the work, the 'harmony' of what we do, it has to all work together. It's like a piece of music in a sense, it's harmonious. We are all very professional. Everyone is always on time. Always, doing their best to present the best to the audience, which I feel we always do.</p>

	<h3>On whether she prefers big crowds or smaller crowds at shows</h3>

	<p>It doesn't matter to me if I am in a stadium with thousands of people or in a much smaller venue. My interaction is with the audience on a one to one. I always try to see their faces and their eyes! I perform and sing to THEM. It's that harmonious vibration, good energy, that flows back and forth between the audience and myself and the band and the music. It's a wonderful thing about music. Music is like love. It feels good. It's about sharing. It's very special. Music is like the heartbeat of our world. Every time I do music from the early days or now, it's the song itself or the music itself has melody and it resonates with the all audiences. And when I am performing it, they become like a brand new song.</p>

	<h3>On why she stays involved in music</h3>

	<p>l do what I do, number one, because I love it. Ever since I was a girl I always loved to sing and perform. The one thing I have never understood...is, searching for fame. To me fame is not a career. You do the work you do, by the way I can almost not call it work, you do what you do because you love it. Most musicians are all the same as this, they are not doing what they do to become "famous." Fame is not a career. Your career is to share your god-given gift. And that is the thing that makes you happy. We get a chance to perform our passion. To do the thing that we LOVE.</p>

	<h3>On her favorite songs</h3>

	<p>I like the song, "I Will Survive" I like the song, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough." I like songs that give positive images. That are positive totally in nature about the thoughts and thinking behind the song. I think that, that's where I really like to stay for myself personally in my thoughts. Songs are positive thoughts. With these songs the energy that happens between the audience and myself is just phenomenal. It's very positive, it's exciting, I like watch them enjoy what we are offering and its really very special.</p>

	<h3>On her legacy, how she wants to be remembered</h3>

	<p>I have always felt its important to stay present. To stay in the moment. To stay now. I never try to think about legacy and being remembered. For me, if I could live a good life now, if I can do the things that bring me joy, if I can enjoy my children and enjoy the weather or whatever it might be....that is LOVE and that is my life.</p>

	<h3>On her stage show, what to expect, etc.</h3>

	<p>As far as my stage show, I like to keep the emphasis on the music. I want very much when the audience comes in to the see the show that there is a good sound. If we keep our attention on presenting good music with a good sound and good visuals that is really what the show is all about. It's about the music and to have their own personal and private memories about each of the songs. That is really the exciting part about being on stage for me, at this time in my life.</p>
